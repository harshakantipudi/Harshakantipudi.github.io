                <li> Hello!!! A hearty welcome to my homepage.
                <li> I am pursuing a professional Masters's degree in Data Science at the University of Bologna, Italy (UniBo). During my recent studies at UniBo, I studied and passed subjects like Data Science in Manufacturing, Social Data Science, and Customer and marketing analytics, which helped me in getting Domain and Industrial knowledge of this multi-disciplinary field. Before joining UniBo, I was working in the IT Industry for three years as a Software Engineer and gained invaluable experience through several projects. Through the constant learning process, I have acquired great skills in resent technical trends including Big Data, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, and Cloud Computing. It is my dream to use this learning experience from both the academia and industrial sectors to solve real-world problems.
                <li>I bring cross functional expertise at the intersection of engineering, computer science, big data, statistics and business to provide quality and scalable solutions.

                <span style="color:black"> Some of my interests include:</span>
                <ul>
                              <li> Modelling semiconductor devices with Machine learning</li>
                              <li> Industry 4.0 Data Scientist with Deep learning and Cloud computing </li>
                              <li> Remote patient Monitoring(Prevention and wellness, chronic care) using Internet of Things (IoT) </li>
                              <li> Edge Computing </li>
                              <li>Integrating and reshaping the health care industry with Data science technologies to derive new insights, and convert ideas into reality.</li>

                <b><span style="color:brown"><font size="4">Career Aspiration</font></span></b> <br>
                 I like to position myself as a Data scientist which essentialy has five elements: data engineering, data visualization, machine learning, big data and cloud computing. <br><br> I aim to be a specilist in two of these areas (machine learning, cloud computing) and a generalist in the other three. This allows me to handle the complete data lifecycle. From identifying the right problem, translating the problem in terms of data, getting the data, building the pipelines, analysing data, building models, presenting findings and putting models in production, I aspire to handle it all.
